## Components

MiniKeys React provides 2 components, a Piano and a Keyboard

### Piano

The piano shows up to a full piano keyboard, with the range of notes that are currently playable by the keyboard, and active playing notes.

### Keyboard

The keyboard shows a representation of your computer keyboard, along with custom modifier keys (sustain, transpose etc.) and active playing notes.

Full documentation is coming soon! For now, have a look through the [Storybook](https://liamp.uk/minikeys-react) to see what props are available.
